I am an Assistant Professor in Statistics at _Universiti Brunei Darussalam_, the leading higher education institution in Brunei.
My research interests lie in statistical theory, methods and computation, with a special inclination towards social science applications.
<!-- I am attached to the Department of Mathematics in the Faculty of Science (FOS), and I run statistics modules for our undergraduate and masters programmes. -->

<!-- I am a Research Officer at the [Centre of Science & Technology, Research & Development (CSTRAD)](https://www2.mindef.gov.bn/cstrad/), Ministry of Defence, Brunei.
My primary task is to provide data analysis and decision support to strategic acquisition projects. 
I also assist in statistical analyses for defence-related research. -->
I obtained my PhD in Statistics from the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) in October 2018.
My PhD project explored the use of *Fisher information*-dependent priors in a vector space framework for regression, classification, and variable selection.
My supervisors were [Dr. Wicher Bergsma](http://stats.lse.ac.uk/bergsma/index.html) and [Prof. Irini Moustaki](http://stats.lse.ac.uk/moustaki/).
I also obtained an MSc in Statistics from LSE in 2014.

I graduated from Warwick University, completing the 4-year MMORSE degree in 2010. As my final year project, I used Bradley-Terry models applied to English Premier League football data. This project was supervised by [Prof. David Firth](http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/firth/).

Previously, I was a Research Officer at the Centre of Science & Technology, Research & Development (CSTRAD), Ministry of Defence, Brunei.
My primary task was to provide data analysis and decision support to strategic acquisition projects, and assist in statistical analyses for defence-related research.
