# Abstract.
abstract = "Institutional mathematics education has long been traditional in its ways of being teacher-centric, a tradition which perhaps dates back to the Ancient Greece. Much like the society in those days, where there was a wary public feeling about the rigidness of the mathematical instruction in Pythagoras’ school, mathematics educators find themselves in a similar position in the common era of 2020. Unlike the Ancient Greece however, the battle is for the continuous delivery of a comprehensive mathematics education in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic. It would be fair to say that mathematics departments across all levels of the education sector have been affected drastically; more so on instructors who prefer the traditional “chalk and talk” method of instruction. In this article, we share several lessons learned in the delivery of mathematical instruction at undergraduate university level during the Covid-19 pandemic, drawing on our experience at Universiti Brunei Darussalam. These include specific methods for implementing online learning effectively, the pros and cons of such methods, and how we can use computer based tools to make learning more conducive. We highly think that these implementations are beneficial to be adapted by mathematics departments anywhere as a means of adapting to the new realities post Covid-19."
