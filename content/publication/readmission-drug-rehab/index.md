# Abstract.
abstract = "Globally, it has been noted that many drug addicts get readmitted to a drug treatment centre after discharged from successful treatment and rehabilitation programs. The objective of this study is to examine the factors contributing to the readmission to a drug rehabilitation centre amongst drug addicts in Brunei Darussalam.\n\nThis retrospective study used de-identified data obtained from the Al-Islah drug rehabilitation centre for the period 1st January 2010 to 31st December 2017. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to estimate and determine significant factors associated with readmission to the drug rehabilitation centre.\n\nA total of 89 subjects (13.1%) were readmitted to the rehabilitation centre within the study period. Multiple logistic regression found that subjects who were in the age group of 40-49 [odds ratio (OR) = 2.34; p = 0.0125], resided in the Belait district (OR = 2.00; p = 0.0350), divorced or widowed (OR = 2.03; p = 0.0187), had committed other criminal offences (OR = 1.85; p = 0.0153) and voluntarily admitted (OR = 2.27; p = 0.0041) were found to be significantly more likely to get readmitted to the rehabilitation centre.\n\nThis study is useful in improving the performance of rehabilitation and treatment programme, or formulating a new programme for specific residents in Brunei Darussalam. Future researchers should consider doing a prospective study by looking at other factors that were significantly associated with readmission in previous studies and explore mixed methods research, combining both qualitative and quantitative research."
