### 2019/20 mid-semester feedback response

- **Unable to relate material to exercises.**
  - I have created a "learning outcome" page on my website to highlight important aspects of the course that you should be familiar with.
  - Often the material contains more than is necessary to tackle the exercises, but this is by design (since I don't provide notes).
  - Another thing to realise: having a solid foundation in basic statistical properties will really help you out in this course. I have prepared an "Exercise 0", one in which ought to help in this regard.

- **Lecture slides contain "Proof as an exercise" blanks.**
  - This is by design, of course, to test your understanding.
  - I also don't go through these because I would like for you to come to me so we can discuss together.
  - My office is always open to my students... just book a slot!
